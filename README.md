# Wonder Wander

> Wonder Wander is a travel site that makes trip planning easy.  Users can base their itineraries off of those of others, or use our generator to create a personalized itinerary based on their preferences.  They can then customize their itinerary using our easy-to-use interface, which displays more suggestions and reviews.  Finally, our site will provide a way to share trip experiences with their friends, both past and present.
