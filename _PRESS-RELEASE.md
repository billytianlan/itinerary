  Wonder Wander
  

## Sub-Heading ##
  For travelers who wish to more easily plan their trips, see information on trips their friends took, and share that of their own.

## Summary ##
  The website will provide travellers with a starting itinerary to build off of. Users can input dates, locations, and a variety of
  preferences, which our server will use to generate an itinerary of sights, restaurants, activities, and lodging. They can also
  read about the itineraries of others', which they can alternatively use as the basis of their itinerary. They can then use our
  schedule interface to finalize their itinerary.

## Problem ##
  While there are plenty of sites that aggregate user reviews of travel attractions, dissecting this information to formulate an
  itinerary can be laborious.

## Solution ##
  Wonder Wander expedites the planning process by giving users itineraries to build off of, whether by algorithm or from other people.
