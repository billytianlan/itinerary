## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Wonder Wander
  

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  For travelers who wish to more easily plan their trips, see information on trips their friends took, and share that of their own.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  The website will provide travellers with a starting itinerary to build off of. Users can input dates, locations, and a variety of
  preferences, which our server will use to generate an itinerary of sights, restaurants, activities, and lodging. They can also
  read about the itineraries of others', which they can alternatively use as the basis of their itinerary. They can then use our
  schedule interface to finalize their itinerary.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  While there are plenty of sites that aggregate user reviews of travel attractions, dissecting this information to formulate an
  itinerary can be laborious.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Wonder Wander expedites the planning process by giving users itineraries to build off of, whether by algorithm or from other people.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Wonder Wander Over Yonder"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Starting is as easy as inputting a where and a when.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Wonder Wander takes away the burden of researching a trip.  It's easy to use and guarantees a fantastic experience."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
